# Play Plane Game

this is a demo project base on Vue3 | Typescript | PixiJS | Vite | Vitest 

## Meaning

1. First of all, learning & practice.
2. Explore a / some way(s) to build components / projects base on TDD.
3. Maybe after finishing this project, I will try to re-edite a famous & greatest game: Battle City. As the picture follows:
